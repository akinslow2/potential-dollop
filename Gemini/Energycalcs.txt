IceMaker:

Energy Consumption:
ideal_run_hours * ice_harvest_rate * energy_use_rate  

hour energy use = ice harvest rate * energy use rate / 24

COST ($/yr)
Electric Cost: 
Summer: hours on peak pricing * hour energy use * peak price + hours on partpeak pricing * hour energy use * partpeak price + hours on offpeak pricing * hour energy use * offpeak price 

Winter: hours on partpeak pricing * hour energy use * partpeak price + hours on offpeak pricing * hour energy use * offpeak price

Total = Summer + Winter


Freezer and Fridges:

hourly energy use = daily energy use / 24

ANNUAL ENERGY (kWh):
Electricity Annual Consumption:
ideal run hours * hourly energy use   

COST ($/yr)
Electric Cost: 
Summer: hours on peak pricing * hourly energy use * peak price + hours on partpeak pricing * hourly energy use * partpeak price + hours on offpeak pricing * hourly energy use * offpeak price 

Winter: hours on partpeak pricing * hourly energy use * partpeak price + hours on offpeak pricing * hourly energy use * offpeak price

Total = Summer + Winter


Cabinet (same as freezers and fridges except for hourly energy use vs. energy use):

energy use = cabinet volume * idle energy rate / 1000

ANNUAL ENERGY (kWh):
Electricity Annual Consumption:
ideal run hours * energy use 

COST ($/yr)
Electric Cost: 
Summer: hours on peak pricing * energy use * peak price + hours on partpeak pricing * energy use * partpeak price + hours on offpeak pricing * energy use * offpeak price 

Winter: hours on partpeak pricing * energy use * partpeak price + hours on offpeak pricing * energy use * offpeak price

Total = Summer + Winter



Fryer (possibly the same as ovens):

ANNUAL ENERGY:
(Gas in BTU, Electricity in kWh)

preheat energy * days in operation + (ideal run hours * idle energy rate)




COST ($/yr)

If Gas oven, use gas equations.
If Electric Oven, use electric equations

Gas Cost = Gas Energy / 99976.1 * (Winter rate + Summer Rate) / 2

Electric Cost: 
Summer: hours on peak pricing * idle energy rate * peak price + hours on partpeak pricing * idle energy rate * partpeak price + hours on offpeak pricing * idle energy rate * offpeak price 

Winter: hours on partpeak pricing * idle energy rate * partpeak price + hours on offpeak pricing * idle energy rate * offpeak price 

Total Electricity = Summer + Winter




Steam Cookers:

ANNUAL ENERGY:
(Gas in BTU, Electricity in kWh)

preheat energy * days in operation + (ideal run hours * idle energy rate)




Griddles (very similar to ovens):

ANNUAL ENERGY:
(Gas in BTU, Electricity in kWh)

preheat energy * days in operation + (ideal run hours * idle energy rate)

COST ($/yr)

If Gas oven, use gas equations.
If Electric Oven, use electric equations

Gas Cost = Gas Energy / 99976.1 * (Winter rate + Summer Rate) / 2

Electric Cost: 
Summer: hours on peak pricing * idle energy rate * peak price + hours on partpeak pricing * idle energy rate * partpeak price + hours on offpeak pricing * idle energy rate * offpeak price 

Winter: hours on partpeak pricing * idle energy rate * partpeak price + hours on offpeak pricing * idle energy rate * offpeak price 

Total Electricity = Summer + Winter
